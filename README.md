# TreeMapTodoList
A project aimed at creating a todo-list by implementing user tasks into a treemap plot function to provide a modern looking todo list designed to encourage users to complete tasks and increase productivity.

This project is starting from scratch. Therefore part 1 will initialise this process by showing the path I have taken in order to accomplish this.

File summaries:
Create Treemap-todo-list-app: Used current Python experience to emulate as close as possible how the webapp should operate in a jupyter notebook. Shows how the interface will look and how the functions will be used.


Project Aims (soon)
